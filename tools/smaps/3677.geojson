The perfection of a basic form. The poetry of a hand-applied brush stroke. In our machine-driven age, these natural and simple essences seem to have become a lost art.\n\nSince our early beginnings, we have been dedicated to the craft of transforming clay into enduring, functional art forms. Working with the basic elements of earth, water, air and fire, skilled artisans create timelessly beautiful dinnerware, bakeware, serving pieces and collectibles that can be enjoyed and cherished for many generations.\n\nSome designs are subtle\u2014others are more striking and exuberant\u2014but what they all have in common is an underlying belief that humble, everyday objects have an important place in our lives and homes.","tags":"stoneware, hand thrown pottery, dinnerware, america pottery makers, stoneware","title":"Louisville Stoneware"}}
