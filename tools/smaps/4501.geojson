Kenyan coffee is known for its high quality control and excellent \"bright coffee that lights up the palate from front to back\" (SM). Specific types of coffee - not\r\nblends - are sold in lots at auction. Buyers are usually either smaller roasters like Sweet Maria's, or traders who then sell the coffee to exporters, or mills and\r\nthen exporters, who in turn sell to large companies like Folger's. Sweet Maria's says \"[w]hen we go after an auction lot, 9 out of 10 times we buy the whole thing; it is exclusively ours\" as opposed to being split up by a trader or co-op. Direct buying is often more equitable than a co-op or trader (see video). Political unrest does affect the market significantly.
