I traced back balloons to see how and where they are manufactured and how much work is needed to get me my balloon.  While finding out the history of how balloons get to me, I noticed I never really realize how many steps are needed to just get the raw materials. Since different things come from all over there is also a lot of transportation to bounce from factorys and stores.  Although we didnt get into the carbon footprint, I can inference that it it so big because of the needs of cetain materials so they can be in there best shape when the come to me, the consumer.  I find that even since I had such a simple object, it had a big impact on people all over the world.","tags":"","title":"It's not a party, without balloons!"},"stops":[{"local_stop_id":9,"id":9,"geometry":"POINT(-5780295.7280935 -1601191.8132151)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-17","description":"Most rubber plants are grown in Brazil.
