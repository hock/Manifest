We will be following a catch of these tuna from commercial fishing grounds to the Oregon market.\n\nTo understand Chicken of the Sea's commodity chain, we must first examine its supply partners. Chicken of the Sea is partnered with Tri-Union Seafoods LLC which is comprised of three companies: Thai Union International Inc., Caribbean Marine Service, Co., and Tri-Marine International, Inc. Each of these partners play a role in the supply and distribution of Chicken of the Sea tuna. However, for simplicity's sake, we will be focusing mainly on Tri-Marine International and their contribution to the supply chain which includes the fishing of tuna, the transport to processing plants, and the canning of that tuna. At processing plants, the tuna receives the Chicken of the Sea brand name and is transported to market by Chicken of the Sea. Though Tri-Marine International accounts for the majority of this map, we have included a few other example of commodity chains that we know exist with Chicken of the Sea canned light tuna.
