The tobacco is then taken to their processing plant on the in the same industrial area. There are lots of different ways to process tobacco. Tipping and threshing is the most popular and most common processing method. The objective of this technique is to remove the backbone of the stem from each leaf. The process occurs many times to strip all the leaves from the stems. The leaves are then sized through sizing shakers to allow for correct packaging prior to export. Once the threshing is completed the tobacco passes through a drying process using heated air flows. The tobacco is then packaged before transport and shipment to customers.","stop_instance_id":"stop-22","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AFQF9x23OkA"}},{"local_stop_id":8,"id":8,"geometry":"POINT(3886029.5057048 -2248977.2908744)","attributes":{"title":"Beira Port","address":"Beira International Airport (BEW), Beira, Mozambique","description":"Beira Port in Mozambique is situated at the mouth of the Pungue River and is linked to malawi only by road.
