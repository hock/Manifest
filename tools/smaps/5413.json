The grapes are chardonnay. The vinyards, in the low hills surrounding Meursault in Burgundy, France, have been in the same family for generations. The grapes are picked by hand from vines older than the farm hands, transported in wicker baskets to the press in which they are crushed and separated from their skins. The juice, in aged barrels, will take two years to ferment and be bottled. Tasting a bottle of wine is taking a trip back in time, as well as space.","address":"21190 Meursault, France","placename":"21190 Meursault, France","title":"Chardonnay grapes and bottling"}},{"local_stop_id":3,"id":3,"geometry":"POINT(-13046308.470068 3864340.346108)","attributes":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-3","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"A very professional pair.

A little voice in her head tried to pipe up - \u201cthey think you\u2019re a sad old lush!\u201d - but she closed her inner ears. She\u2019d learnt a lot about wine anyway, though in these parts developing a taste for the good stuff led to some seriously disappointing dinner party experiences. When the woman came in she was fairly unremarkable. Ethel was staring at her drink and barely attended to the conversation.
