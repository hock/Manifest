It is decorated with a depiction of the western trading posts on the waterfront at Canton (Guanghzhou).\r\n\r\nPatricia Ferguson, who has researched this bowl, dates it to either 1786 or 1788. This is based on a comparison between the national flags shown on the bowl and dated records and pictures of the trading activities in Canton. The bowl appears in an 1806 inventory of Nostell Priory, but it is not known how it was originally acquired \u2013 the Winn family of Nostell Priory had no links with the China trade. Patricia Ferguson makes the amusing suggestion that Sir Rowland Winn, sixth Baronet (1775-1805), who was a keen fox hunter, may have won the bowl as a prize for winning a horse race.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/nttreasurehunt.wordpress.com\/category\/chinese-export-wares\/","address":"Banbury OX15 6HT, UK","title":"National Trust (2008)","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"local_stop_id":10,"id":10,"geometry":"POINT(-7949075.2470108 5135073.9527817)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-267","description":"The bowl was presented to the Museum by daughter of Ann Allen Dorr Ives, Hope Brown Russell, in 1909.
