When dissecting an Ipod, the most expensive parts were the hard drives, the display units and memory chips.  All these parts are made in Asia under cheap labour where they are then sent to China for final assembly.  The companies in charge of assembly are Asutek, Invintec Appliances and Foxconn.  There are over 450 parts in an Ipod 30 gigabyte video, some parts worth pennies and others more.  Once manufactured, Ipods are then distributed world wide, where ultimately Apple makes the greatest profit for having down the least amount of work.","stop_instance_id":"stop-241","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[113.42391260921,39.748785030789]},"properties":{"title":"Assembly","address":"G18, Hunyuan, Datong, Shanxi, China","description":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[127.76692198221,35.907756995657],[113.42391260921,39.748785030789]]},"properties":{"co2e":"0","title":"Memory card to Assembly","distance":"2118.363697"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[120.96051498316,23.697809996889],[113.42391260921,39.748785030789]]},"properties":{"distance":"2103.135865","co2e":"0","title":"Chips to Assembly"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[121.77401698304,12.879720998237],[113.42391260921,39.748785030789]]},"properties":{"title":"Hard drive to Assembly","distance":"3102.746513","co2e":"0"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[103.81983598554,1.3520829998118],[113.42391260921,39.748785030789]]},"properties":{"co2e":"0","title":"Video\/multimedia processor to Assembly","distance":"4378.846437"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[113.42391260921,39.748785030789],[-119.41793238338,36.778260995585]]},"properties":{"distance":"9938.300067","co2e":"0","title":"Assembly to Final Distribution"}}],"properties":{"tags":"","description":"where ipods are made","title":"ipod","sm:ui:tileset":"terrain"}}
