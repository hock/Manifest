There are more than five million cocoa farmers working in rural parts of West Africa, Asia and the Americas. The large number of individual farmers means it is difficult to trace the cocoa beans from the start to the end of the supply chain.\r\n\r\nCocoa is harvested by hand rather than machine because pods ripen at different rates and have to be individually selected. After harvesting the pods, the farmers break them open to reveal the beans, encased in a sweet pulp. These are fermented with the pulp to create the \"chocolate\" flavor and then dried to avoid mold before being sold to local buyers. \r\n\r\n(source = www.mars.com)","stop_instance_id":"stop-169","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"local_stop_id":7,"id":7,"geometry":"POINT(-9529211.6032498 1433354.7059225)","attributes":{"title":"cocoa","address":"Central America","description":"Demand for cocoa is rising and unless something is done supply will soon not keep pace. There are a number of reasons for this. Cocoa is a labor-intensive crop grown mostly in developing countries. Farmers struggle with aging trees, pests and disease, depleted soils and poor access to training and other resources.\r\n\r\nAs a result, farmers produce small amounts of cocoa and often don't earn incomes above subsistence levels. This makes it difficult for individual farmers to invest in their farms, families and communities in ways that could help raise them out of poverty. The consequence is a decline in production year on year - a situation that benefits no one.\r\n\r\n(source = www.mars.com)","stop_instance_id":"stop-202","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"local_stop_id":6,"id":6,"geometry":"POINT(-6177282.9621468 -981592.86045974)","attributes":{"title":"cocoa","address":"South America","description":"","stop_instance_id":"stop-248","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1"}},{"local_stop_id":5,"id":5,"geometry":"POINT(-11838468.393581 7584411.7316911)","attributes":{"title":"paper","address":"Canada","description":"","stop_instance_id":"stop-289","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1"}},{"local_stop_id":4,"id":4,"geometry":"POINT(-11686845.336077 4827879.1955225)","attributes":{"title":"Consumer","address":"Denver, CO, USA","description":"Chocolate is one of the world's favorite foods and its popularity is rising.
