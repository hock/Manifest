We're all located in the fertile lower Fraser Valley and on Vancouver Island. We take pride in the fact that our province is the largest producer of cranberries in Canada, averaging about 84 million pounds of fruit every year. Approximately 95% of our cranberries are processed into juice, sauce, sweetened dried cranberries and other healthy products. The other 5% are sold fresh to families all over the world\" (Oceanspray 2013).","address":"Richmond, BC, Canada","title":"Cranberries"}}],"properties":{"title":"Ocean Spray","description":"","tags":""}}
