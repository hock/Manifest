It was created by studying the production process of the pen and the factory information in BIC's annual sustainability report.  When tracing backwards, I had to make assumptions about from where BIC draws its raw materials.  I assumed the tungsten for tungsten carbide balls in the ballpoint comes from Nanling, China, which supplies the majority of the world supply.  I also made similar assumptions based on likelihood of stainless steel sources, ink materials, etc.","tags":""}}
