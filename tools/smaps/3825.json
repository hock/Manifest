Throughout the process of researching the supply chain of gummy bears, I was surprised to learn how many ingredients from all over the world are shipped to the factory, then to the distribution center, then to Denver CO. It made me realize how much fuel is used just to get one item to me, and all of the things that companies could do to be better to the environment. One idea I have is to make the distribution center and the factory in the same place so that the product doesn't have to be shipped halfway around the world from the factory to the distribution center.  \nCreated by Mackenzie ","tags":"supplychain odyssey","title":"How Gummy Bears Get to Me!
