Until now, these langoustines were mechanically peeled in local units, and sold in British chains of stores, such as Marks and Spencer. To maximize its earnings, the American investment fund which owns Young\u2019s Seafood, but also the frozen-food brand Findus, decided a shift in the production model. Langoustines are from now on frozen, transported to Thailand where they are manually peeled, and then sent back to Scotland where they are cooked and commercialized. ","tags":""}}
