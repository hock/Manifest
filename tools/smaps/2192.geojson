I still don't know exactly when soap makers shifted from potash created by burning forests to local made caustic soda or mined potash from Germany. It is also not clear whether most soap makers used coconut and palm oil, along with tallow and other animal fats by the end of the century. I do know that Britain's imports of these two fats grew massively during the century and that John Knight's Primrose Soap factory is mentioned in the secondary sources on the palm oil trade.","tags":"","title":"19th Century West Ham Soap Industry"}}
