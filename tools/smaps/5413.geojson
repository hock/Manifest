The grapes are chardonnay. The vinyards, in the low hills surrounding Meursault in Burgundy, France, have been in the same family for generations. The grapes are picked by hand from vines older than the farm hands, transported in wicker baskets to the press in which they are crushed and separated from their skins. The juice, in aged barrels, will take two years to ferment and be bottled. Tasting a bottle of wine is taking a trip back in time, as well as space.","address":"21190 Meursault, France","placename":"21190 Meursault, France","title":"Chardonnay grapes and bottling"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.196983,32.766415000003]},"properties":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-3","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"A very professional pair.

Even if she didn\u2019t meet a man, and she invariably failed to, she could have an interesting chat with the staff. A little voice in her head tried to pipe up - \u201cthey think you\u2019re a sad old lush!\u201d - but she closed her inner ears. She\u2019d learnt a lot about wine anyway, though in these parts developing a taste for the good stuff led to some seriously disappointing dinner party experiences. When the woman came in she was fairly unremarkable. Ethel was staring at her drink and barely attended to the conversation. If she had, she\u2019d have noticed that the woman was clearly clueless about wine and was making a brave choice spending over $50 on a bottle of blended white.","address":"San Diego, CA, USA","placename":"San Diego, CA, USA","title":"Wine Shop"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.0841955,32.640054099998]},"properties":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-9","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"She couldn\u2019t see it, but Sarah knew the bottle was there, just waiting for Valentine\u2019s Day.
