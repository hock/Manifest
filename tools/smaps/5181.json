In the 1970's, the warehouse relocated across the street, which allowed the vacant building to be converted into a Tim Hortons restaurant with adjoining offices. Today the building is used solely for office space and has grown from less than 10,000 square feet on one floor, to over 73,000 square feet over three floors and is home to more than 700 corporate employees - an expansion which parallels the growth the Tim Hortons chain. In Oakville, the Head Office buildings include: the Tim Hortons University, Corporate Restaurants and the Innovation Center.\r\n\r\nRetreived from http:\/\/www.timhortons.com\/ca\/en\/join\/structure.html","address":"Oakville, ON, Canada","title":"Tim Horton's Head office"}},{"local_stop_id":2,"id":2,"geometry":"POINT(-8514377.4954603 5501286.5079299)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-5","description":"Regional Offices typically have smaller teams handling many of the same departmental functions as those found in Oakville.","address":"Kingston, ON, Canada","title":"Tim Horton's Regional Office"}},{"local_stop_id":1,"id":1,"geometry":"POINT(-8843212.5216265 5560131.6764704)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-1","description":"This is the store where you purchase your cup of coffee.","address":"175 Westmount Drive North, Orillia, ON L3V 7T7, Canada","title":"Tim Horton's Orillia"}}],"hops":[{"from_stop_id":3,"to_stop_id":2,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8870308.0864319 5380719.2025584,-8514377.4954603 5501286.5079299))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","title":"Tim Horton's Head office to Tim Horton's Regional Office","distance":"270.724579"}},{"from_stop_id":2,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8514377.4954603 5501286.5079299,-8843212.5216265 5560131.6764704))","attributes":{"distance":"238.313271","co2e":"0","title":"Tim Horton's Regional Office to Tim Horton's Orillia"}},{"from_stop_id":4,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8933185.0417623 5395267.7885518,-8843212.5216265 5560131.6764704))","attributes":{"title":"Distribution Center to Tim Horton's Orillia","co2e":"0","distance":"134.772099"}},{"from_stop_id":6,"to_stop_id":4,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8639608.3047019 5336514.4616764,-8933185.0417623 5395267.7885518))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","title":"Roasting Facility to Distribution Center","distance":"217.450300"}},{"from_stop_id":6,"to_stop_id":5,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8639608.3047019 5336514.4616764,-8514377.4954603 5501286.5079299))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","title":"Roasting Facility to Distribution Center","distance":"149.460533"}},{"from_stop_id":7,"to_stop_id":4,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8890652.6250595 5350105.3216535,-8933185.0417623 5395267.7885518))","attributes":{"distance":"45.026203","co2e":"0","title":"Roasting Center to Distribution Center"}},{"from_stop_id":7,"to_stop_id":5,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8890652.6250595 5350105.3216535,-8514377.4954603 5501286.5079299))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","distance":"292.613910","title":"Roasting Facility to Distribution Center"}},{"from_stop_id":8,"to_stop_id":6,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-5780295.7280935 -1601191.8132151,-8639608.3047019 5336514.4616764))","attributes":{"title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility","distance":"6897.749374","co2e":"0"}},{"from_stop_id":8,"to_stop_id":7,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-5780295.7280935 -1601191.8132151,-8890652.6250595 5350105.3216535))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility","distance":"6996.469106"}},{"from_stop_id":9,"to_stop_id":6,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8270741.275707 509367.28126829,-8639608.3047019 5336514.4616764))","attributes":{"distance":"4303.431746","co2e":"0","title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility"}},{"from_stop_id":9,"to_stop_id":7,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8270741.275707 509367.28126829,-8890652.6250595 5350105.3216535))","attributes":{"title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility","co2e":"0","distance":"4335.739036"}},{"from_stop_id":10,"to_stop_id":6,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-10044442.144372 1779661.0115165,-8639608.3047019 5336514.4616764))","attributes":{"title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility","co2e":"0","distance":"3271.415494"}},{"from_stop_id":10,"to_stop_id":7,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-10044442.144372 1779661.0115165,-8890652.6250595 5350105.3216535))","attributes":{"title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility","co2e":"0","distance":"3208.537146"}},{"from_stop_id":11,"to_stop_id":6,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-9600404.9483055 1712260.1402682,-8639608.3047019 5336514.4616764))","attributes":{"title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility","co2e":"0","distance":"3215.766062"}},{"from_stop_id":11,"to_stop_id":7,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-9600404.9483055 1712260.1402682,-8890652.6250595 5350105.3216535))","attributes":{"title":"Coffee Farms to Roasting Facility","co2e":"0","distance":"3177.419375"}}]},"editable":false}
