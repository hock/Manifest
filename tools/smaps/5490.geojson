Earth to tantalum is a vigorous and toxic process. First, large amounts of earth are uncovered, and the ore is extracted from the earth by digging and blasting. The ore is crushed by hand or machine and then digested with hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid. This happens at or near the site to increase concentration of shipped material.
