The final product is a blade that weighs less than .5 pounds but it will support over 60 pounds of force.  This same process is used to make aerospace, aircraft and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) components.  The manufacturing process was developed by a team based in Neodesha and Wichita, KS.","tags":"","title":"Carbon fiber wind turbine blade"},"stops":[{"local_stop_id":1,"id":1,"geometry":"POINT(-10651077.609178 4497586.9290917)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-1","description":"We manufacture composite components for aircraft, unmanned vehicles (UAV), boats, trucks, medical equipment, radomes, wind turbine nacelle, water treatment plant components, fiberglass shelters and precision aircraft carbon fiber components.   We also have the ability to design and build quality composite components starting from an idea to a product.  A niche that we serve is carbon fiber infused components.  They are foam cored encapsulated in various layers of carbon fiber.  This process creates components that are very light but yet very strong.  For example, we are able to build small wind turbine blades that weigh less than 1\/2 pound, but yet strong enough to support 60 pounds.  Also, if the components are required to stand up to high heat usage, we have the ability to ensure that components will provide the service required for the environment they will be used in.  In cases where weight is very critical, we can also make the components hollow to further reduce weight.
