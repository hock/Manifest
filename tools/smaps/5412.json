Ever since, he\u2019d been humming the song most mornings, as he looked out off the back porch over the low, green fields. He was doing it now, contemplating what dad would have made of his decision to sign up to this Conservation Reserve Program, putting 20 per cent of the farm out of production to bring the wildlife back to the state, and reduce carbon emissions. With Obama\u2019s subsidies he\u2019d be able to keep afloat, he calculated - but it was a big risk.

The new machines were installed and whirring, but were they shelling peanuts any faster than the old gear? Had it been a good investment?

Still, they\u2019d apparently passed all the safety inspections and nothing was making any weird noise so... He turned his back and went into his office.
