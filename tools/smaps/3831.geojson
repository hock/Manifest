The simplest things in my life might actualy be quite more complicated then i first antisipated. for exaple i never gave any thought before now to where a c-d actualy comes from,but now thet i know i am shocked about the ,very stange, and secret life of this product. it slos taught me about how items are carried around the world so that it can get to me. the last thing i learned wa that any item in my life can have a very weird way of getting to me,and a long proccess to being made. this i swhat i took out of this project that

alluminum coating overthe base layer, and a clear lare of protective plastic. the first step to making a c-d is probaly the hardest. all the supplies arre shipped in from around the world and the c-d's mechinary is all put into the small base layer of a c-d. this proccess may take 2-3 hours(with the propper mechinary). the next step is called electro forming. in this step mor ealuminum is added to the c-d to make it stronger. then the protective layers of plastic and polycarbonate plastic are added. then finally replication. millions of coppies are made of the c-d so that they can be
