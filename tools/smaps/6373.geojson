Whole Foods loved it, and Honest Tea found its first shelf space. It was a logical initial step: The tea came from natural ingredients. Whole Foods sells only natural goods.\r\n\r\nGoldman faced a problem though when he took the tea to other distributors. They hated it.\r\n\r\n\"They said it wasn't sweet enough. They said it tasted like grass,\" he said at the Inc. 500|5000 Conference.\r\n\r\nSo to get the product to new stores, in front of more customers, Goldman broke down the supply chain. To get to gourmet stores, he contracted with a cheese distributor, who would bring Honest Tea on his truck along with his cheddars and mozzarellas. To reach delis, he contacted a corned-beef distributor. For grocery stores: a charcoal distributor.","address":"Boston, MA, USA","title":"Whole Foods"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.820133689724,41.055096895266]},"properties":{"youtube:link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Faq1u5OOyD8","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-66","description":"The bottles are sent to the distributor, who then ships them off to retail locations.  2010: Honest Tea launches a guerrilla marketing effort called \"Honest Cities.\" Unmanned kiosks filled with Honest Tea products were set up in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.
