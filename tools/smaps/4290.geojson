Tallow was used to make soap and candles. The majority of imported tallow came from Northern Europe and most of this came from Russia. I've pieced together some sources that suggest sheep from the Kazakh Steppe were processed near Orenburg and then shipped to Britain through Arkhangelst (the White Sea Route). Large amounts of tallow likely came from cattle raised on the Pontic-Caspian steppe and slaughtered for their tallow and hides. They were processed throughout the steepe at  sagans, where hundreds of oxen were killed and boiled. ","title":"British Tallow Imports 1784-86","sm:ui:tileset":"satellite"}}
