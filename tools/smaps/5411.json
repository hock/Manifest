Her mum had taken her iPod off her, so she couldn\u2019t even drown out the voice of this boring man doing the tour. Who cares how they pick the stupid berries anyway?

Still, it kept Emilio paid in between gigs, and he had all the strawberries he could eat.

Inside, a young guy moved the topmost boxes onto another trolley, and wheeled them out onto the shop floor just as the instore lights blinked on.","address":"711 University Avenue, Whole Foods Market, San Diego, CA 92103, USA","placename":"711 University Avenue, Whole Foods Market, San Diego, CA 92103, USA","title":"WholeFoods Market"}},{"local_stop_id":1,"id":1,"geometry":"POINT(-13033753.023 3847624.046814)","attributes":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-17","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"It was getting to be 2:30 pm. Sarah was a bit peckish after her lunch of half a can of soup and a piece of toast. Stupid diet. Surely a few strawberries wouldn\u2019t hurt. She went to the fridge and pulled out a punnet. For a moment she wrestled with the lid - she didn\u2019t like this awkward packaging, it was much more fun when they went and picked their own in little cardboard punnets like when she\u2019d been a kid. The package popped open, but Sarah fumbled and the strawberries cascaded onto the floor. \u201cWell, they\u2019re all bruised now,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cThey won\u2019t last.
