This coffee is sold from the estate in Lahaina, Maui, and elsewhere in Hawaii and thus is the shortest commodity chain that exists for coffee. Hawaii is special because they are able to grow and roast their coffee very locally, which is not at all the case for the rest of the world. Additionally, there are no customs on Hawaiian coffee because it is a US state, so it can be brought to the mainland more easily.
