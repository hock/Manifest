However, now I know that even a small thing that I eat everyday can have things that come from all over the world. After researching pickles and other supply chains, I realized that everything, not just pickles, has a lot of different steps in order to get to you. I also learned that there are four different parts of the supply chain. The first is supply, the process of getting all of the raw materials needed to make the product. The second is manufacturing, the step where the raw materials get turned into products. The last two are Distribution and consumption, where the product gets given to the final seller and that consumed by whoever buys it. By learning these processes, where everything I have comes from is a lot more clear to me. By Grace","tags":"sourcemap odyssey","title":"the path of pickles"}}
