It's very hard to find data on such a specific kind of factory, so I'm not sure on how the workers are treated. I would assume that they are exploited just as many Chinese people are due to very low cost of manual labor. Whoever owns the company benefits greatly from this, as they get more profit from selling their product. Every graphite refinery I've come across has been owned by a bigger, multi-national company. I wouldn't be surprised if locally owned refineries just aren't a thing.

The average wage is $680 per month. Without more data, I can only take an educated guess in saying that the workers here are average or slightly below for Brazil. They are much better off then workers in China though, and that I can say with certainty. Faber-Castell claims to be as eco-friendly as they can, by doing things like using water-based paint in their products.
