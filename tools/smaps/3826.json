On a deeper level too, how flutes are made.  Now when ever I buy or consume something I am thinking about how it's made and where it comes from.  I knew that some products had a lot of ingertens, but I didn't realize that there are a lot of this that go into products that we don't even know what they are.  It was also crazy to see that some products don't even come from anywhere near the US 'till distrubution or manufunctoring, even something that has only 4 or so fondation products.  This project made me thanful for the unseen people that put in so much hard work and labor to make the simplest things.  It also made me more aware and cousios about some foods or\/and products.
