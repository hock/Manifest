This is based on a comparison between the national flags shown on the bowl and dated records and pictures of the trading activities in Canton. The bowl appears in an 1806 inventory of Nostell Priory, but it is not known how it was originally acquired \u2013 the Winn family of Nostell Priory had no links with the China trade.
