I researched comic books, which are of much importance to many. But seeing where it came from was crazy. But what I found even crazier was that almost all products came from this process. Thinking that a little rubber band could have been to Austria, China, then the USA never occurred to me, but now as I walk through a store I always think a little bit more about where things come from. Supply chain to me means that wherever things were originally created then joined with something else then packaged is the chain that holds down the demanding monster of the society. I think this because if not for every link on the chain that monster would not get what it wants it will be angry. That monster being mad is not good. that is why supply chain is so important, if not for all the different places the product goes the society would erupt in frustration.
