The headquarters of BMW is Munich, Germany. This manufacturing company was founded by Franz Josef Popp. Before the car manufacturer became popular as a car manufacturer, it used create engines for airplanes. Interestingly enough, BMW has created a vehicle in early 19th century that had an engine of an aircraft. In almost 100 years BMW has become a significant company that kept its brand name at the high level. Anything that Bavarian Motor Works bought, it was turned into success. For example, the BMW Group started as a company that worked by themselves, after they became more profitable they started to invest money into motorcycle development. This investment turned out very well, to this day people value BMW motorcycles as the top quality product. In late 1990's BMW made an astonishing move by buying out the Rolls Royce before the Volskwagen group could get their hands on it. Rolls-Royce products became even better under BMW Group control, these cars are build by hand and use only the best materials found on the planet. The base price is around $300,000.\nIn early 2000, BMW purchased the MINI company and created an amazing line up of MINI vehicles under their control. They have kept all the original interior and exterior design of the classic MINI but at the same time added quality, power, design, features, and safety to these vehicles.\n\n","tags":"","title":"Bavarian Motor Werks (BMW Group)","sm:ui:weight":"1"},"stops":[{"local_stop_id":8,"id":8,"geometry":"POINT(-13704979.639029 6319302.7796957)","attributes":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-264","description":"","address":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","title":"BMW Vancouver"}},{"local_stop_id":7,"id":7,"geometry":"POINT(4187327.27359 7507382.4403243)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"5","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-193","description":"","address":"Moscow, Russia","title":"BMW Moscow head office"}},{"local_stop_id":6,"id":6,"geometry":"POINT(-8836895.6525945 5411933.9985733)","attributes":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-150","description":"","address":"Toronto, ON, Canada","title":"BMW Toronto"}},{"local_stop_id":5,"id":5,"geometry":"POINT(-8963490.9938901 5382905.7222028)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"1","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-124","description":"BMW\/Mini dealer","address":"Waterloo, ON, Canada","title":"Bmw Grand River"}},{"local_stop_id":4,"id":4,"geometry":"POINT(1288755.218023 6129611.5190524)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2zppS8p4DxQ","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"2","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-91","description":"Bavarian Motor Werks is German automobile, engine and motorcycle manufacturer that was founded as early as 1917.
