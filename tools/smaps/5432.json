Bottling facilities & partners across the globe\n\n2. Regional distribution centers\n\nIt is important to note that the key resources for coke products range from plastics, to aluminum, to water, this makes it difficult to trace every component involved in producing the coke product and thus only the bottling and distribution will be shown on this map.","tags":""},"stops":[{"local_stop_id":19,"id":19,"geometry":"POINT(9499263.2093264 3211203.0333244)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-1081","description":"This is the principal bottling location of Coca-Cola SABCO in Nepal.
