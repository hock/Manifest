"}}],"properties":{"title":"\"I, Pencil\" and Negative Externalities","description":"\"I, Pencil\" is an essay written by Leonard Read and popularized by economist Milton Friedman.  The essay describes how no single person is capable of making a pencil by themselves due to the underestimated complexity of the production process.      \n\nFriedman used the article to explain how the capitalist process can allow large numbers of people to produce complex goods without centralized planning.  \n\nThis map is based on Friedman's talks about \"I, Pencil\" and ties a simplified version of the pencil production process to a negative externality (carbon dioxide equivalent produced during transportation), the significance of which was unknown at the time of the original essay.    \n\nSources:\n\"I, Pencil\": \"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I,_Pencil\".
