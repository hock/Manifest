At the production plants they design the sticks to have the flex and grip that everyone wants in a great stick. Bauer has designed their sticks to perform with anyone's style of hockey, giving lots of options, for both power forwards or defence. They are made of 20% graphite and 80% fibreglass. Graphite is a mineral and comes from the Earth's surface. Fibreglass was originally from the United States, but now is world-wide. The tape that is used for hockey sticks in made in the United States as well. \r\n\r\nIn the video below it explains how the Bauer Vapour X60 is at the top of the line and how Bauer has made it better for everyone that uses it with a different design.
