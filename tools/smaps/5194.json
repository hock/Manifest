After all of the oranges are clean, an extraction process occurs.  The oranges are peeled and the oils are taken out.  Once this process has occurred, the juices are sucked out and sent to a specialized machine that takes out the pulp and seeds.  After this process occurs, the orange juice is now ready to be put into a carton and shipped off to retailers around the world by air, ground travel, and through waterways.  Packaging the orange juice is all done at the same factory, and some of the orange juice is frozen into Tropicana freezer packs.

Here, each orange is inspected individually to ensure it is adequate enough to use in making the orange juice.  At this factory, the oranges go through a minimum maturity checklist and are scanned to ensure the orange is okay to give to the public.
