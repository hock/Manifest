Lily lagged behind as the tour around the Manzanita berry farm progressed. She dearly wanted to stamp on one of the fragile plants, squishing the ripe strawberries to a pulp. She was so bored. Her mum had taken her iPod off her, so she couldn\u2019t even drown out the voice of this boring man doing the tour. Who cares how they pick the stupid berries anyway? Maybe if they all looked the other way, she could make a run for the mountains.","address":"Santa Maria, CA, USA","placename":"Santa Maria, CA, USA","title":"Strawberry fields"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.476675,34.936800999997]},"properties":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-4","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"The corrugated trays were delivered from Robert Mann packaging in the morning. Delicious strawberries rolled into them, filling them. Then they were weighed, the boxes placed on a conveyer belt once their weight was within tolerance. It wasn\u2019t an exciting job, checking none of them were smashed and that people were getting a fair portion in their package. Still, it kept Emilio paid in between gigs, and he had all the strawberries he could eat. Not bad for a starving artist.","address":"1850 West Stowell Road, Santa Maria, CA 93458, USA","placename":"1850 West Stowell Road, Santa Maria, CA 93458, USA","title":"Berry boxing"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.1580524,32.747957600001]},"properties":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-24","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"A bright morning in San Diego and the sun had been up for about an hour when the delivery van pulled into the alley behind Whole Foods. Strawberries, in plastic boxes inside cardboard boxes, were the first thing to be unloaded. The team of two stacked box on crate on box on crate on wheels until the pile stood higher than either of them, then pushed it inside through the metal-protected double doors into the shop\u2019s store. Inside, a young guy moved the topmost boxes onto another trolley, and wheeled them out onto the shop floor just as the instore lights blinked on.","address":"711 University Avenue, Whole Foods Market, San Diego, CA 92103, USA","placename":"711 University Avenue, Whole Foods Market, San Diego, CA 92103, USA","title":"WholeFoods Market"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.0841955,32.640054099998]},"properties":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-17","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"It was getting to be 2:30 pm. Sarah was a bit peckish after her lunch of half a can of soup and a piece of toast. Stupid diet. Surely a few strawberries wouldn\u2019t hurt. She went to the fridge and pulled out a punnet. For a moment she wrestled with the lid - she didn\u2019t like this awkward packaging, it was much more fun when they went and picked their own in little cardboard punnets like when she\u2019d been a kid. The package popped open, but Sarah fumbled and the strawberries cascaded onto the floor. \u201cWell, they\u2019re all bruised now,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cThey won\u2019t last.
