The ore usually contains less than 1% copper. The ore is ground, concentrated, and slurried with water and chemical reagents. Air blown through the mixture attaches to the copper, causing it to float to the top of the slurry. The copper is then removed with a skimmer. After this happens the copper is dried, making the slurry into a dry powder. This powder is then fed into a furnace, the impurities and the copper melt, and the two are segregated. With the copper floating to the bottom and the slag, or impurities, floating to the top where they are taken out. After this the copper and other heavy impurities are put into a converter, where air, lime, and silica are added to react with iron. Here the iron is the slag and is extracted to be recycled. The final step is fire refining, air and natural gas is blown through the copper, to remove any remaining sulfar and oxygen. Then the copper is cast into copper anodes and charged, leaving 99% cp.","address":"Chile","title":"Copper"}},{"local_stop_id":11,"id":11,"geometry":"POINT(-9951798.6466388 4958377.3504908)","attributes":{"title":"Polyurethane","address":"Illinois, USA","description":"Oil is shipped to a processing plant where the oil is broken down and then mixed with a variety of additives, polyalcohals, and catalysts to create polyurethane.

First steel is mined, then the ore is melted down and is purified by using flux. Flux almost sucks up all of the metals impurities out of a molten ore and can be multiple things. The most economical choice for flux is wood shavings. The type of alloy that is added to the iron can change the steels performance in terms of hardness, ductility, and tensile strength. The most commonly used alloy is carbon, when used to create Steel its presence is usually 0.2% to 2.1% by weight. This percentage varies depending on the grade of steel. After the alloy is added, the molten ore is poured into a simple mold where it is allowed to cool. From here it is transported a port to be shipped.","stop_instance_id":"stop-86","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"local_stop_id":9,"id":9,"geometry":"POINT(11598978.535428 4281602.6590309)","attributes":{"title":"Cement","address":"China","description":"","stop_instance_id":"stop-168","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1"}},{"local_stop_id":8,"id":8,"geometry":"POINT(13522390.872171 3662706.3452481)","attributes":{"title":"Chinas Main Port","address":"Shanghai, China","description":"","stop_instance_id":"stop-249","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"local_stop_id":7,"id":7,"geometry":"POINT(-10257537.205046 3664585.1050181)","attributes":{"title":"U.S. Main port","address":"Louisiana, USA","description":"This port receives aver 400 million tons of trade and resources each year.

Titanium is never found in its pure form, it is usually found in three ores, ilmenite, leucoxene, and rutile. Ilmenite and leucoxene are two ores of similar composition, however ilmenite contains about 53% titanium oxide and leucoxene contains about 90% titanium oxide. How titanium is extracted is through the Kroll process, which involves extraction, purification, and then producing a sponge. When a sponge is made titanium is made into a block with magnesium and magnesium chloride. To remove these impurities it is then treated with water and hydrochloric acid, which takes the impurities out and leaves the block looking like a sponge.","stop_instance_id":"stop-417","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1"}},{"local_stop_id":5,"id":5,"geometry":"POINT(16137213.530983 -4553128.6697898)","attributes":{"youtube:link":"","water":"0","energy":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","title":"Australia's Main Port","address":"Melbourne VIC, Australia","description":"The titanium reaches the port, where it is shipped to Lousiana","stop_instance_id":"stop-438","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1"}},{"local_stop_id":4,"id":4,"geometry":"POINT(-13324741.568954 4085450.2288026)","attributes":{"title":"Polyurethane wheels","address":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","description":"Polyurethane is molded and cooled\/dried to allow for a wheel shape to be held.
