What systems are involved? How do these systems interact?\"We can use this information to feed more people and find efficiencies to improve our systems.\nFurthermore, this information is of interest to municipalities, city planners and individuals, all of whom need to eat! With a global population now exceeding 7 billion, the answers to these questions are becoming increasingly valuable toensure we use our finite resources to their maximum potential. We begin in the city of Austin. We seek to find a storythat will have global applications.","tags":""}}
