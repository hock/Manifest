Factory machines mold the bottle into its final shape, and it is shipped from the headquarters to retailers across the country, such as Wal Mart.  Water bottles in general can be used a great number of times, or only once.  Once used, this water bottle can be easily recycled due to its status as a number 1 plastic.  Recycling is a simple process, and nearly everyone has access to the means to recycle a number 1 plastic, so this process really should occur anytime one uses a Nestle Purelife water bottle.","address":"Stamford, CT 06902, USA","title":"Nestle Purelife Waters North America"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-73.541743989763,41.041119395267],[-87.635445987801,37.97317599549]]},"properties":{"distance":"1254.714043","title":"Nestle Purelife Waters North America to Evansville Wal Mart","co2e":"0","description":"This is the Wal Mart where the bottle was purchased.
