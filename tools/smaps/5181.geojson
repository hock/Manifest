In the 1970's, the warehouse relocated across the street, which allowed the vacant building to be converted into a Tim Hortons restaurant with adjoining offices. Today the building is used solely for office space and has grown from less than 10,000 square feet on one floor, to over 73,000 square feet over three floors and is home to more than 700 corporate employees - an expansion which parallels the growth the Tim Hortons chain.
