He could feel the roughness of the wicker basket pressing down through his loose, ill-fitting shirt. The bushes weren\u2019t so healthy after the frost, most of the young shoots shrivelled, dead on the branches. He picked around the damage, but his load was much smaller than it usually would be so near the end of the day. The frosts were getting harsher - and the days hotter - he was sure. As the light failed he headed back to the warehouse to deposit the tea. He greeted some colleagues warmly, discussing the frost, and the impact it was having on the small farm. There was talk of wage cuts - down from 200-odd shillings per day closer to the minimum of 178.8. He left for home worried. His family could barely get by on his earnings as it was.","address":"Kenya","title":"tea producer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[80.777580500003,7.9502735999961]},"properties":{"placename":"Sri Lanka","stop_instance_id":"stop-152","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","energy":"0","water":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"\u201cAh, Ceylon!
