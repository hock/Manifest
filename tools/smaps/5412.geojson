Back to its previous state. Evaporation makes the salt granules more salty.

His city job had left him empty at the end of each hectic week, so when his dad died he\u2019d decided to head back home to Georgia. Ever since, he\u2019d been humming the song most mornings, as he looked out off the back porch over the low, green fields. He was doing it now, contemplating what dad would have made of his decision to sign up to this Conservation Reserve Program, putting 20 per cent of the farm out of production to bring the wildlife back to the state, and reduce carbon emissions. With Obama\u2019s subsidies he\u2019d be able to keep afloat, he calculated - but it was a big risk. He looked back into the house at his twin girls. \u201cThey need a future,\u201d he reassured himself, \u201cand someone has to secure it for them.

The new machines were installed and whirring, but were they shelling peanuts any faster than the old gear? Had it been a good investment? It seemed like it when he agreed to buy the shellers directly from the Indian seller, but after waiting 3 months for them to arrive now he wasn\u2019t so sure. Still, they\u2019d apparently passed all the safety inspections and nothing was making any weird noise so... He turned his back and went into his office. These days it was a bit hand-to-mouth at the factory.

It was borne of social awkwardness, but knowing that didn\u2019t make it any easier for either of them.
