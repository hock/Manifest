Wanting to help, he created TOMS Shoes, a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need. One for One. Blake returned to Argentina with a group of family, friends and staff later that year with 10,000 pairs of shoes made possible by TOMS customers. The One for One movement is about people making everyday choices to improve the lives of children. ","sm:ui:tileset":"satellite","tags":"toms","title":"TOMS"}}
