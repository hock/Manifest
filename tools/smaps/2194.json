Howard & Sons were a leading chemical manufacturer in the nineteenth century. They began processing cinchona bark into purified quinine crystals in the 1820. By the 1860s they, along with government officials, worried that the high demand for this commodity might result in a collapse in supply. As a result, John Eliot Howard worked with Kew Gardens, Clements Markam and officials in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India to secure a British supply. They conspired to smuggle seeds out of the Andes so they could cultivate the trees in plantations. Howard provided the essential scientific and technical knowledge on what spices of cinchona should be chosen. Subsequent historical research suggests the supply from the Andes remained stable through the nineteenth century, as the harvesters used relatively sustainable methods to harvest the bark, but the plantations in Java, started by the Dutch, emerged as the dominant suppliers at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe map also shows the downstream trade of quinine out to the Niger Delta and India, as a reminder that this produce was essential for the expansion of European empires in the 19th century.","tags":"","title":"19th Century Howard & Sons Quinine"},"stops":[{"local_stop_id":9,"id":9,"geometry":"POINT(8110311.122159 2157009.870384)","attributes":{"address":"Bombay","placename":"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","title":"Quinine","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":8,"id":8,"geometry":"POINT(719297.012333 581788.991239)","attributes":{"address":"5.219067,  6.461555","placename":"5.219067,6.461555","title":"Qunine","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":7,"id":7,"geometry":"POINT(12681664.112134 -87864.470043)","attributes":{"address":"Indonisia","placename":"Indonesia","title":"Cinchona Plantation","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":6,"id":6,"geometry":"POINT(8537687.976129 1278842.40104)","attributes":{"address":"Ooty, Tamil Nadu","placename":"Ooty, Tamil Nadu, India","title":"Cinchona Plantation","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":5,"id":5,"geometry":"POINT(-7078656.47219 -1838348.789522)","attributes":{"address":"Bolivia","placename":"Bolivia","title":"Cinchona Forests","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":4,"id":4,"geometry":"POINT(-8270741.276858 509367.281339)","attributes":{"address":"Columbia","placename":"Colombia","title":"Cinchona Forests","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":3,"id":3,"geometry":"POINT(-8350648.52242 -1027437.355768)","attributes":{"address":"Peru","placename":"Peru","title":"Cinchona Forests","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":2,"id":2,"geometry":"POINT(-1012.11681 6716251.560774)","attributes":{"address":"51.533722, -0.009092","placename":"51.533722,-0.009091999999999999","title":"Qunine","description":""}},{"local_stop_id":1,"id":1,"geometry":"POINT(2686.584591 6711430.873123)","attributes":{"address":"51.506776, 0.024134","placename":"51.506776,0.024134","title":"West Ham Industry","description":""}}],"hops":[{"from_stop_id":2,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-1012.11681 6716251.560774,2686.584591 6711430.873123))","attributes":{"title":"Qunine to West Ham Industry","distance":"3.776572"}},{"from_stop_id":3,"to_stop_id":2,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8350648.52242 -1027437.355768,-1012.11681 6716251.560774))","attributes":{"distance":"9792.018625","title":"Cinchona Forests to Qunine"}},{"from_stop_id":4,"to_stop_id":2,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8270741.276858 509367.281339,-1012.11681 6716251.560774))","attributes":{"title":"Cinchona Forests to Qunine","distance":"8526.933305"}},{"from_stop_id":5,"to_stop_id":2,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-7078656.47219 -1838348.789522,-1012.11681 6716251.560774))","attributes":{"title":"Cinchona Forests to Qunine","distance":"9714.067076"}},{"from_stop_id":6,"to_stop_id":2,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((8537687.976129 1278842.40104,-1012.11681 6716251.560774))","attributes":{"title":"Cinchona Plantation to Qunine","distance":"8098.730429"}},{"from_stop_id":7,"to_stop_id":2,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((12681664.112134 -87864.470043,-1012.11681 6716251.560774))","attributes":{"title":"Cinchona Plantation to Qunine","distance":"11703.610341"}},{"from_stop_id":1,"to_stop_id":8,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((2686.584591 6711430.873123,719297.012333 581788.991239))","attributes":{"title":"West Ham Industry to Qunine","distance":"5181.316928"}},{"from_stop_id":1,"to_stop_id":9,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((2686.584591 6711430.873123,8110311.122159 2157009.870384))","attributes":{"title":"West Ham Industry to Quinine","distance":"7184.577725"}}]},"editable":false}
