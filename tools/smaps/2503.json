In general, men's clothing fetches a higher price because there is less of it. More women shop in the United States, so more of their clothes are donated to poor countries, making the men's apparel more valuable. Winter clothes are also frequently donated, making them far cheaper in comparison to casual wear than here in the USA. Here in the USA, winter clothes tend to be very expensive. Of course, everything is more expensive when it's brand new.","address":"Dodoma, Tanzania","title":"Exported here","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"local_stop_id":7,"id":7,"geometry":"POINT(15550409.622327 4257979.0183313)","attributes":{"supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-90","description":"The Japanese people receive used clothing from the United States.
