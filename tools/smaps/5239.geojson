When the aluminum comes out of the ovens, it is suitable for milling.Steelworkers then run the aluminum through six sets of rollers to flatten it to the appropriate thickness for home use: usually .6 mils (or .006 of an inch) for standard household foil.  It goes to the ovens a second time to bake off any chemicals that might contaminate food and is then cut, spooled and boxed.
