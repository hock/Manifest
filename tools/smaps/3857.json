While I was going in depth about this product I found that even a simple & common item like a pencil could possibly draw resources from every corner of the globe. This whole project showed me that a supply chain can change drastically based on the function the product is expected to do, and the commonness of an item (The pencil for example) will give most people a false perception of the complexity of the supply chain for that object.

First graphite, clay, and water are mixed in order to create a paste that will be cooked into a solid rod. Meanwhile the cedar log would be cut into blocks that would be 7.25\" x 0.25\" x 2.75\", these will be cut again into cylinders that are split to have led placed inside. Then the graphite rod will be placed between the sides of one of these cylinders then glued together, painted, varnished then have an eraser clamped to the top with a tin ring. By this point the pencil is packed and shipped out for sale.
