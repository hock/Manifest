When dissecting an Ipod, the most expensive parts were the hard drives, the display units and memory chips.  All these parts are made in Asia under cheap labour where they are then sent to China for final assembly.  The companies in charge of assembly are Asutek, Invintec Appliances and Foxconn.  There are over 450 parts in an Ipod 30 gigabyte video, some parts worth pennies and others more.  Once manufactured, Ipods are then distributed world wide, where ultimately Apple makes the greatest profit for having down the least amount of work.","stop_instance_id":"stop-241","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","weight":"0","co2e":"0","energy":"0","water":"0","youtube:link":""}},{"local_stop_id":1,"id":1,"geometry":"POINT(12626292.1954378 4829503.27770278)","attributes":{"title":"Assembly","address":"G18, Hunyuan, Datong, Shanxi, China","description":""}}],"hops":[{"from_stop_id":3,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((14222948.695284 4287936.2888022,12626292.195438 4829503.2777028))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","title":"Memory card to Assembly","distance":"2118.363697"}},{"from_stop_id":5,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((13465262.934018 2716627.9388584,12626292.195438 4829503.2777028))","attributes":{"distance":"2103.135865","co2e":"0","title":"Chips to Assembly"}},{"from_stop_id":6,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((13555821.562404 1445993.9972958,12626292.195438 4829503.2777028))","attributes":{"title":"Hard drive to Assembly","distance":"3102.746513","co2e":"0"}},{"from_stop_id":4,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((11557171.276152 150527.16261961,12626292.195438 4829503.2777028))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","title":"Video\/multimedia processor to Assembly","distance":"4378.846437"}},{"from_stop_id":1,"to_stop_id":2,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((12626292.195438 4829503.2777028,-13293543.424503 4408244.1333355))","attributes":{"distance":"9938.300067","co2e":"0","title":"Assembly to Final Distribution"}}]},"editable":false}
