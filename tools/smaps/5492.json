The palm tress itself has broad fan like leaves that are attached to toothed stalks. Nature provides the wax for this unbelievable palm tree to protect it from the heat and various elements of its surroundings.In order to collect the carnauba wax off of the leaves of the palm would be collected and allowed to dry. Once the leaves were dried they would be beaten to dislodge yellowish and brown waxy carnauba flakes. Some wax flakes are used in the natural state for various products while some will be refined to variable degrees to be used for premium car care wax lines. Depending o the level or percentage of refined carnauba will dictate the level of shine and protection as well as the durability of the product. Once the wax is collected it is refined and then re-refine.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/happysunshineland.hubpages.com\/hub\/WHAT-IS-CARNAUBA-WAX-AND-WHERE-DOES-IT-COME-FROM","stop_instance_id":"stop-9","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1"}},{"local_stop_id":1,"id":1,"geometry":"POINT(-7730634.234772 5661563.3010131)","attributes":{"title":"Tom`s of Maine Processing Plant","address":"Maine, USA","description":""}}],"hops":[{"from_stop_id":2,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-5780295.7280935 -1601191.8132151,-7730634.234772 5661563.3010131))","attributes":{"distance":"6846.499510","title":"Carnauba wax to Tom`s of Maine Processing Plant","co2e":"0"}},{"from_stop_id":3,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-12524064.598835 3947925.2474039,-7730634.234772 5661563.3010131))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","title":"Jojoba wax to Tom`s of Maine Processing Plant","distance":"3878.550828"}},{"from_stop_id":4,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-12959747.10014 4158339.095201,-7730634.234772 5661563.3010131))","attributes":{"distance":"4093.106145","co2e":"0","title":"Jojoba wax to Tom`s of Maine Processing Plant"}},{"from_stop_id":5,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-11035458.233728 2205935.2695919,-7730634.234772 5661563.3010131))","attributes":{"co2e":"0","distance":"3959.453154","title":"Jojoba wax to Tom`s of Maine Processing Plant"}},{"from_stop_id":6,"to_stop_id":1,"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((3363811.8520282 1444062.6095178,-7730634.234772 5661563.3010131))","attributes":{"distance":"9734.074177","youtube:link":"","weight":"0","transportcat":"Method of Transportation","description":"The tree is of great economic importance for the gum arabic it produces to be is used as a food additive, in crafts, and as a cosmetic.
