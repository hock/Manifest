The dense canopy shields these wandering beasts from the midday sun. The forest is centuries old, the ebony trees 200 years old, merely teenagers. But there has been a cull, like Logan\u2019s Run for the forest, all the mature trees have been cut down, milled for wood. They can\u2019t grow fast enough to keep up - and now they are endangered.  Things are changing. Americans come in and buy the mills, renovate, say they will pay better wages, make the conditions better, to the watchword \u201csustainable\u201d... for at least 5% of the wood they source.

The demand for the precious wood had added to the drastic loss of forest coverage and fragmented the forest, disrupting ecological pathways. About 10 per cent of the Amazon forest had already been lost in 2001. That year, the Brazilian government brought in a certification program for the wood, which capped the amount of mahogany logging allowed. Deforestation rates have indeed fallen, in part due to decreased logging. There is still a good deal of illegal logging, with all the associated violence that is borne of an endeavour working outside the law. The criminals are driven to logging areas set aside to preserve indigenous peoples\u2019 way of life.","address":"Par\u00e1, Brazil","placename":"Par\u00e1, Brazil","title":"Mahogany Wood"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-48.476092000001,-1.3792890000007]},"properties":{"water":"0","energy":"0","supplychain_instance_id":"supplychain-1","stop_instance_id":"stop-121","co2e":"0","weight":"0","description":"Great chains on great cranes clank and clink as they haul their heavy loads.

Skinny with shoulder-length hair, tatty Bon Jovi t-shirt, Converse sneakers. Standard. The guy sized up the guitars hanging lovingly in rows around the store. Emilio didn\u2019t offer to help. Finally, the customer picked down a Martin. Emilio couldn\u2019t even bring himself to mutter \u201cnice choice\u201d as he rang it through, beset as he was by a pounding headache.

It had just been the two of them, years before the kids were born. Sarah awoke to Martin bringing coffee and pastries into the bedroom. She remembers fondly how he lent over to kiss her and nearly knocked a full latte onto the carpet. Not that it would have mattered, a coffee stain would have only improved the interior decoration.  When they went into the living room, there it was under their makeshift Christmas branch, festooned with paperchains made from the pages of catalogues. A Martin guitar, from her Martin. She played it every day since, except when she was in hospital in labour.  The guitar's soft mahogany body vibrates with every pluck of its steel strings. It sings to Sarah's touch just as her own body sings to Martin's fingers running over her skin.","address":"Chula Vista, CA, USA","placename":"Chula Vista, CA, USA","title":"Sarah's Guitar"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.4226274,37.790811799998],[-117.0841955,32.640054099998]]},"properties":{"distance":"750.182158","title":"Guitar Centre to Sarah's Guitar"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-75.3096237,40.740374999998],[-122.4226274,37.790811799998]]},"properties":{"distance":"4020.449072","title":"Guitar Manufacture to Guitar Centre"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-66.461916399999,46.565316299999],[-75.3096237,40.740374999998]]},"properties":{"distance":"961.307136","title":"Red Cedar Wood to Guitar Manufacture"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-95.369389599997,29.760192700002],[-75.3096237,40.740374999998]]},"properties":{"distance":"2184.471142","title":"Bronze to Guitar Manufacture"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-48.476092000001,-1.3792890000007],[-75.3096237,40.740374999998]]},"properties":{"distance":"5413.643973","title":"Shipping Port to Guitar Manufacture"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-52.7027956,-6.2071020000016],[-48.476092000001,-1.3792890000007]]},"properties":{"distance":"712.723176","title":"Mahogany Wood to Shipping Port"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[6.2509070999995,5.2373219000038],[-75.3096237,40.740374999998]]},"properties":{"distance":"8917.192416","title":"Ebony Wood to Guitar Manufacture"}}],"properties":{"tags":"guitar, wood, bronze, fiction","description":"What networks flow into and out of your life?
