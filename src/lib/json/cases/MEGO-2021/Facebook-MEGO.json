Arvato has 70,000 employees in more than 40 countries and has provided Facebook with content moderation services since 2015. It is a german company that aids Facebook computer services. Facebook is one of Arvato's largest clients but stays silent surronding content moderation. It is clear that Arvato removes harmful content on Facebook, but there is little to nothing surrounding Facebook's interactions with this company. Employees' accounts mention that there were moderators worldwide, and employees were advised not to tell anyone what they were doing for the company. They explained that the company did not adequately train their employees and, due to the secretive surrounding these issues, did not feel as if they had a voice.

Anna Heraty played a significant role in the companies success; she was awarded as a pioneering entrepreneur because of her ability to locate and fill the positions of content moderators in Ireland. CPL moderates for big Social Media Companies, including; Facebook, Google, and TikTok. Despite CPL's success in this market, they have received backlash due to Facebook's moderators' work conditions on the job. According to The Guardian, CPL's Facebook content moderators were \"forced\" to work in the Dublin office, although the \"high tier lockdown\" was in place due to Covid-19 guidelines, while Facebook's workers worked from home. \"A CPL spokesperson said: 'Our employees carry out extremely important work, keeping the Facebook platform safe. They are positively contributing to society in the work they do in ensuring the safety of our online communities, and their roles are deemed essential. Due to the nature of the work, it cannot be carried out from home'\" (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/facebook-content-moderators-urge-mark-zuckerberg-to-let-them-work-remotely.htm). A moderator at CPL said, \"'We want the same rights and protections as Facebook employees. The way Facebook organizes this work feels discriminatory and unfair. Facebook is one of the world's richest companies, yet Facebook asks us to risk our life, to come into work, and keep Facebook safe and profitable. Why can't they afford to hire us?\"' (https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/backlash-at-facebook-s-outsourcing-firms-policing-social-media-1.1173158) Over the past year, more than 200 moderators informed Facebook about their concerns surrounding the current pandemic. Facebook came back and said that the content is too graphic to be viewed from home. CNBC published a report by Sam Shead on November 12th, 2020, titled, \"TikTok is luring Facebook moderators to fill new trust and safety hubs\" (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/tiktok-luring-facebook-content-moderators.html). In this article, Shead explains how \"many content moderators who work at outsourcing firms like Accenture, CPL, Hays, and Voxpro have been leaving to take in-house roles at TikTok, according to LinkedIn analysis by CNBC.\" These firms are \"under contract with Facebook.\"\nAccording to the same source, Chirs gray, a 54-year-old man based in Dublin, worked for CPL for ten mounts. Gray said he had to deal with \"nasty stuff\" and explained the horrific content he saw while shuffling through 100 pieces of reported content an hour. While working the night shift at CPL. According to CNBC he, \"was paid 12 euros 98 cents ($15.39) up until 8 p.m., when the pay went up 25%. \"That's not a lot of money,\" he said, adding that Dublin is one of the most expensive cities in Europe. Employees were fed food that had been shipped in from the nearby Facebook office and reheated, said Gray, who worked at CPL from June 2017 to April 2018.\" Grey is not the only one who has experienced this, \"Dozens of contractors from across the EU that is in the process of using Facebook and CPL for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\" He explains that Face book has been \"willfully blind to what was going on\" and did not care for its people. Face book now provides 24-hour on-site counseling, \"in order for outsourcing companies to do Facebook content moderating.\" </p>"},"location":{"address":"CPL Aromas FZE, PO Box 17643, S31202, Jebel Ali Free Zone, Dubai, United Arab Emirates\n","geocode":"24.969347,55.123802"},"attributes":{"destinationindex":"24","image":[],"sources":[{"source":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256232/facebook-content-moderators-ireland-work-from-home-rights-coronavirus"},{"source":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256232/facebook-content-moderators-ireland-work-from-home-rights-coronavirus"},{"source":"https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/backlash-at-facebook-s-outsourcing-firms-policing-social-media-1.1173158"},{"source":"https://www.foxglove.org.uk/news/open-letter-from-content-moderators-re-pandemic"},{"source":"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/tiktok-luring-facebook-content-moderators.html"},{"source":"https://www.cpl.com/ie/for-clients/cpl-services/talent-solutions-services/enterprise-solutions/recruitment-process-outsourcing-rpo"},{"source":"https://www.cpl.com/branches/belfast"},{"source":"https://www.cplaromas.com/about-cpl/where-we-operate/"}]},"measures":{"measures":[]},"notes":{"markdown":"","keyvals":[{"key":"","value":""}]}},{"overview":{"index":226,"name":"Pro Unlimited, Inc.","description":"<p>The contractor Pro Unlimited, Inc. helps Facebook manage and locate temporary employees to work as content moderators.
