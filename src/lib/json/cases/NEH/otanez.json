{"summary":{"name":"Tobacco Leaf Supply Chain","description":"<p>Unmanufactured tobacco leaf exports from Malawi, Africa, with a focus on the top five countries that receive leaf exports from Malawi. Different segments of the tobacco leaf supply chain are featured in this project. Segments begin in Lilongwe, Malawi, where tobacco arrives from farms in different regions in the country. In Lilongwe, several cigarette leaf manufacturers including US-based Universal Corporation and US-based Alliance One International purchase leaf through pre-arranged contracts with local farmers. A small portion of the tobacco is purchased at open markets in Malawi. Leaf buyers process the tobacco and prepare it for shipping by primarily removing the stems from tobacco leaves. Unmanufactured tobacco is shipped in containers and transported from Lilongwe to the ports in Mozambique and South Africa. After leaving the ports tobacco shipments are transported to Belgium, Germany, Poland, Egypt and the United States. These are the top five countries that receive tobacco exports from Malawi. British American Tobacco, Philp Morris, Japan Tobacco and other global cigarette manufacturers receive the shipments. Next, tobacco is processed into cigarette brands such as Marlboro and Camel and ultimately delivered to distributors, retailers and consumers. Additional research is needed to determine the length of time containers of unmanufactured tobacco is stored before use and to what degree cigarette manufacturers influence global tobacco markets and prices through the manipulation of inventories of unmanufactured tobacco exports from Malawi.\n<div class=\"cite\">Marty Otañez, \"Tobacco Leaf Supply Chain,\" <em>Manifest: Supply Chain Platform</em> (2024)</div></p>"},"nodes":[{"overview":{"index":1,"name":"Limbe Leaf Tobacco Company Ltd","description":"<p>This is a leaf buying company and one of the largest exporters of unmanufactured tobacco in Malawi.
