{"summary":{"name":"Aditi Mayer: Sustainable Fashion Influencer Media Production/Distribution Map","description":"<p>Zizi Li’s dissertation research suggests there are two ways in which sustainable fashion influencers relate to supply chains. First, sustainable fashion is deeply embedded in regular supply chains and brand-centered economies. Second, sustainable fashion influencers also engage in the production of alternative supply chains. These engagements often occur through side research projects that accompany more common brand campaigns presented at influencers social media, i.e., Instagram.<br/><br/>Building on this finding, the researcher decided to map these on-the-side research projects. She mapped the locations, communities, events, and other elements this sustainable fashion influencer showcased on her Instagram. For example, in her Instagram, Mayer explains her ethical shift towards sustainable fashion took place after the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh back in 2013. This event is not Mayer’s personal experience but a key event in the recent history of labor struggle in fashion.<br/><br/>A second project showcased is Mayers’ collaboration with the Garment Workers’ Center as part of the campaign “Pay Up Ross.” A third project is “Portraits of Village Economies” in the cotton belt of Punjab. She portrayed these economies as another way of thinking about sustainable fashion. The researcher mapped key locations the influencer identified as part of this sustainable fashion alternative ecosystem. Although presented as an ecosystem, it is clear that this can also be mapped as a supply chain.\n<div class=\"cite\">Zizi Li, \"Aditi Mayer: Sustainable Fashion Influencer Media Production/Distribution Map,\" <em>Manifest: Supply Chain Platform</em> (2024)</div></p>"},"nodes":[{"overview":{"index":1,"name":"Aditi Mayer","description":"<p>The creator I am focusing on for this project.

On April 23rd, 2013, large cracks were discovered in the building, but the garment factory owners ignored the warnings and forced the workers to return to work the following day.

Four members of the Garment Worker Center worked in these factories, and went on to bring forward wage claims to the California Labor Commission. They won their case and the court ordered that they be paid over $800,000 in back-owed wages. But their owed wages still weren't paid.
