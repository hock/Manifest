Although Chile is the world's leading producer for this metal, according to Apple's 2022 supplier list, there are no suppliers based in Chile. Thus, if we look at other top producers such as Peru, the Congo, and China, we can assume that Apple gets their copper from China (as it is the only country listed while the other copper-producing countries are not).
