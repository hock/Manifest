{"summary":{"name":"Champion Petfoods (Canada)","description":"This [commodity biography](https://sites.google.com/site/mydogsdinnersourcemap/home) follows several Canadian ingredients to the Champion Petfoods factory in Morinville, Alberta, where the end product is then exported to 50 countries globally. It shows the Canadian farms and factories where ingredients come from, though some of these places have specific information, while others have minimal details. It also shows the countries which import Champion Petfoods’ products.  The company ships to hundreds of cities throughout several countries, but the map shows only one entry for each country. On the company’s website each distributor per international country is listed, and this is the address used for each country."},"nodes":[{"overview":{"index":1,"name":"Champion
