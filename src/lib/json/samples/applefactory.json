I’d go home from work, eat a tv-dinner, watch Star Trek, and often head back to the building. I sometimes worked on HP stuff at night but usually my own fun constructions.\""},

"description":"**1975: The development of the Apple I** \n\n \"The Advanced Products Department began its life with the 1972 introduction of the HP-35 handheld calculator (which had been developed at HP Labs). The HP-35 was the most exciting product ever introduced by HP. The APD was an immediate success and moved from 10900 Wolfe Road to a nearby leased building at 19310 Pruneridge Avenue where it experienced explosive growth. By August of 1975 HP had shipped over a million handheld calculators.\" \n\n \"While designing scientific calculators at HP during the day, Wozniak developed what would become the Apple I at night and on weekends — often in his HP cubicle. 'I begged (HP) to make the (Apple I),' Wozniak said. 'Five times they turned me down.'\""},

"description":"**1975: The development of the Apple I** \n\n \"The suburban garage at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is said to be the birthplace of Apple computers. But this might be an overstatement. In a 2014 interview, Steve Wozniak explained that '[w]e did no designs there, no breadboarding, no prototyping, no planning of products. We did no manufacturing there.' 'The garage didn’t serve much purpose, except it was something for us to feel was our home.' 'We had no money. You have to work out of your home when you have no money.'\""},

"description":"**1976: The \"Good Earth\" Building** \n\n \"Mark Johnson: 'It was a rather small office space... This one office included the lobby and office space without a dividing wall. When you turn to the right, you enter the manufacturing area. Incidentally, Apple occupied the adjacent office space to the right of suite C. A smaller office space where Bill Fernandez designed circuit board layouts.'\n\n Chris Espinosa: 'Carpeting on the left, linoleum on the right. Marketing and Admin on carpet, engineering and manufacturing on linoleum.' \n\n Andy Hertzfeld: 'In fact, the office used to be Apple's very first office in Cupertino, after they moved out of Steve Jobs' parents' house, and was later used as the first office of the Lisa project, when the Lisa team had fewer than ten employees. The Mac team moved in, outfitting it with lots of bean bag chairs and all kinds of interesting toys.'\""},
