	,"name":"Epoxy Resin","description":"Epoxy resins, also known as polyepoxides, are a class of reactive prepolymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups. Epoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding integrated circuits, transistors and hybrid circuits, and making printed circuit boards. The largest volume type of circuit board—an 'FR-4 board'—is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards."},"location":{"address":"Shanghai, China","geocode":"31.230708000001,121.472918"},"attributes":{"destinationindex":"1","image":[{"URL":""}],"sources":[{"source":""}]},"measures":{"measures":[{"mtype":"weight","munit":"kg","mvalue":"0.15"},{"mtype":"co2e","munit":"kg","mvalue":"0.5"}]},"notes":{"markdown":"Clayton May, 'Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology; (2nd ed.).
