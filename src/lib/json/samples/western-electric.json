{"summary":{"name":"Western Electric Telephone (1927)","description":"This is a reconstruction of the supply chain for the Western Electric produced telephones of the late 1920s. The information for this historic Manifest is drawn from archival Western Electric/AT&T materials--expecially the 1927 document, _From the Far Corners of the Earth_ and Western Electric's _Material Series_ advertisements. It also incorporates records of some supplier companies. While this appears to be an example of a **Component/Constitution Manifest**, unlike the vast number of subassemblies for a telephone today the supply chain of the telephone was heavily centralized at Western Electric's Hawthorne Works. Nor was it sold commercially (telephones were leased to subscribers). And so it is equally reasonable to consider it as a kind of **Upstream/Downstream Manifest**.

Galvanizing consists of covering sheet iron or steel with a thin coating of zinc in order to protect it from the effects of moisture. About 50 per cent of our output of metallic zine is thus used. Another large use for zinc is in paints. Zine oxide is used in making the millions of automobile tires produced every year.

Often a single shipment of silk to this country is worth as much as $5,000,000 Or $6,000,000. Telegraph cables and radio messages follow the fast ship laden with its costly cargo from the day it leaves the Oriental port until it reaches our Pacific Coast. The ship radios ahead when it has a silk cargo aboard. Outside the harbor, custom officials meet the vessel and inspect it. At the pier a special train which carries only silk is ready to steam away as soon as the cars are loaded.
