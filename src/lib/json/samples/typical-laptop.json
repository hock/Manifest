{"summary":{"name":"Typical Laptop Computer (2007)","description":"\"It would be impossible to trace in a magazine article the origin of every single component in your notebook, because it contains hundreds of parts, including microchips, the hard drive, the battery pack, the LCD, circuit boards, resistors, capacitors, wires, and even the pieces of metal and plastic that make up the casing. But we can take a look at the web of production leading up to one component—the CPU—and use that to shed some light on just how global the PC industry has become.\" <br/><br/>This is a Manifest based on Dylan Tweney's 2007 PC Magazine article [\"What's Inside Your Laptop?\"](https://dylan.tweney.com/2007/03/13/whats-inside-your-laptop/) It isn't a comprehensive examination of a specific laptop (though it references Dell's Latitude D600—a 1.8-GHz Pentium M 745, with 512MB of RAM, 802.11g wireless, a DVD burner, and an 80GB hard drive), rather it is an example of a **Component/Constitution Manifest**.

Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding integrated circuits, transistors and hybrid circuits, and making printed circuit boards. The largest volume type of circuit board—an 'FR-4 board'—is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards."},"location":{"address":"Shanghai, China","geocode":"31.230708000001,121.472918"},"attributes":{"destinationindex":"1","image":[{"URL":""}],"sources":[{"source":""}]},"measures":{"measures":[{"mtype":"weight","munit":"kg","mvalue":"0.15"},{"mtype":"co2e","munit":"kg","mvalue":"0.5"}]},"notes":{"markdown":"Clayton May, 'Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology; (2nd ed.).
