        <p class="callout">Manifest is an investigative toolkit intended for researchers, journalists, students, and scholars interested in visualizing, analyzing, and documenting supply chains, production lines, and trade networks. </p>

        <p>Professional logistics platforms developed by companies like SAP, Oracle, and IBM are incredibly complex, suited to global networks with hundreds of suppliers in dozens of countries. These systems interface with numerous data sources, offering powerful capabilities for controlling the world's material distribution in the name of "supply chain management." Manifest is not one of these. Similarly, there are many powerful tools available for detailed statistical evaluation, graph analysis, and geospatial modeling. And while Manifest can work in concert with these tools, the project's primary purpose is to: </p>
        <ul class="dotlist">
            <li>
                <div class="listdot"></div>Provide common data standards for describing and sharing supply chains or similar material networks, along with a simple editor modeled on these standards.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="listdot"></div>Develop a flexible geospatial viewer for supply chain data that is transparent, interactive, and simple to understand, with support for additional, specialized data views (graph relationships, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="listdot"></div>Support basic analytic tools for evaluating and comparing critical supply chain measures.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result is (hopefully) a system that is more flexible--someone using Manifest might find it valuable to map very high level connection, or to include "materials" not normally be present in an industrial logistics platform. In pursuit of these goals, Manifest has been developed with a number of core design principles:</p>
        <ul class="dotlist">
            <li>
                <div class="listdot"></div>Manifest is not a database. While we are happy to host datasets on request, the workflow for creating and viewing data happens entirely in the browser&mdash;the system neither sees nor stores the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="listdot"></div>Supply chains in Manifest were not designed to be discrete "documents." The interface was developed for multiple supply chains (or partial supply chains) in order to understand relationships between them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="listdot"></div>Manifest data tends to be descriptive, rather than rigidly structured. The format is designed to include information across a range of different contexts, irrespective of rendering for a particular piece of data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="callout">The project is supported by Fordham University's Office of Research and Department of Communication and Media Studies. It was previously supported by the <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/">Media, Culture, and Communication</a> department of <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>. Manifest is based on technologies originally developed as part of the <a href="http://supplystudies.com/sourcemap-org/">Sourcemap project</a>, which was originally created at the MIT Media Lab in 2007 as a collaboration between the MIT Center for Civic Media and the Tangible Media Group to enable the dissemination of open supply chains and support the evaluation of their social and environmental impacts.</p>
